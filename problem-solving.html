          <h2>1. Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
          <p>So, I was working on this simple coding task, and I got totally stuck. The problem was a missing semicolon (which is like a little dot at the end of a sentence in coding). I couldn’t figure out why my code wasn’t working, and I felt like I was going crazy because I was sure it should be something easy.</p>
          <p>To fix it, I tried a few things: I looked over my code carefully, tried breaking it into smaller bits to see if anything stood out, and Googled the error message to see if others had the same problem. Eventually, I just stepped away, took a deep breath, and came back to it. That’s when I saw it—the missing semicolon!</p>
          <p>I felt pretty frustrated at first, like I should’ve figured it out sooner. But when I found the mistake, I was relieved, even though I felt a little silly. The lesson here? Sometimes the problem is small, but taking a break and coming back to it with fresh eyes can really help.</p>

          <h2>2. Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
          <p>There was another time I was trying to make something show up on the screen, and it wasn’t working. It was a bit tricky because I had to get data from one place to another, but I broke the problem down step by step. First, I checked what was wrong, fixed a couple of small things, and finally, everything just worked!</p>
          <p>When it worked, I felt so proud! It was like a lightbulb moment—everything just clicked, and I knew exactly what I was doing. The key thing I learned? Don’t try to do everything at once. Take it one step at a time, and things will come together.</p>

          <h2>3. Reflecting on Confidence with Problem-Solving</h2>
          <p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Writing down my ideas first (like a rough plan) before jumping into the code makes me feel more confident. It helps me figure out what I want to do before doing it.</p>
          <p><strong>Trying something:</strong> I just try things out, even if I’m not sure if they’ll work. It’s like learning by doing. Sometimes it doesn’t work, but that’s how I learn!</p>
          <p><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> When I explain my problem out loud to a random object (like computer lo), it helps me think better. It’s like having a conversation with myself, but it works!</p>
          <p><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> I used to get scared of error messages, but now I know they actually tell me what went wrong. I just have to break them down and figure out what the code is trying to tell me.</p>
          <p><strong>Console logging:</strong> It’s like a little detective tool that shows me where things are breaking.</p>
          <p><strong>Googling:</strong> If I can’t figure something out, I Google it or use AI. There’s so much helpful stuff online, and I’m never alone in my confusion! AI helps break down everything! giving examples on why this and that happens with codes.</p>
          <p><strong>Asking peers for help:</strong> I’m still shy about asking my study mates for help, but I’ve realised it’s okay to ask when I’m stuck.</p>
          <p><strong>Asking Facilitators for help:</strong> Asking them for help feels easier. There’s no shame in reaching out.</p>
          <p><strong>Improving my process with reflection:</strong> After solving problems, I like to think about what worked and what didn’t. It helps me improve and feel more confident next time.</p>

          <h2>4. Reluctant to Ask for Help</h2>
          <p>There was a time when I was stuck on something and didn’t want to ask for help because I didn’t want to look dumb. But after a while, I realised that asking for help is just part of learning. Everyone starts somewhere, and it’s okay not to know everything.</p>
          <p>Next time, I think I’ll ask for help earlier. It’s better to get the answers I need and keep moving forward than to waste time trying to figure it out alone. People are there to help, and that’s what matters.</p>
