              <h2>1. Taha Wairua (Spiritual Well-being)</h2>
              <p>My energy is deeply connected to guidance, wisdom, and seeing the bigger picture. I thrive when I feel recognized and invited into the right spaces. Spiritually, this means:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Finding environments and people that honor my insight.</li>
                <li>Giving myself permission to rest and recharge without guilt.</li>
                <li>Exploring practices like meditation, journaling, or quiet reflection to reconnect with myself.</li>
                <li>I feel most spiritually aligned when I balance my alone time for deep reflection with meaningful relationships that appreciate my wisdom.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="eq">
              <h2>2. Taha Hinengaro (Mental & Emotional Well-being)</h2>
              <p>I absorb and amplify the energy of those around me, which means my mental and emotional balance is crucial. To support my Taha Hinengaro:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I set clear boundaries to protect my energy and avoid burnout.</li>
                <li>I engage in conversations that stimulate my mind but don’t drain me.</li>
                <li>I express my thoughts and feelings in ways that feel authentic, whether through writing, talking, or creative outlets.</li>
                <li>I acknowledge when I need alone time to process emotions.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I sometimes struggle with feeling seen or misunderstood. But I remind myself that I don’t have to prove my worth—I bring value through my guidance, authenticity, and ability to uplift others.</p>

            <div class="iq">
              <h2>3. Taha Tinana (Physical Well-being)</h2>
              <p>I don’t have consistent energy like others, so my body thrives on quality over quantity when it comes to movement and activity. To maintain my physical well-being:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I listen to my body's natural rhythm and rest when needed.</li>
                <li>I choose exercises that feel light and nourishing rather than draining (e.g., yoga, pilates, walking).</li>
                <li>I prioritize good sleep and nutritious food to sustain my energy.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>My physical well-being is influenced by my environment—a calm, structured, and supportive space helps me feel my best.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="eq">
              <h2>4. Taha Whānau (Social Well-being)</h2>
              <p>Relationships and connections are vital for my overall well-being. I thrive when I have a strong, close-knit circle where I feel valued and invited to share my wisdom. To nourish my Taha Whānau:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I surround myself with people who recognize my gifts and appreciate my insights.</li>
                <li>I maintain healthy social interactions, balancing time alone with meaningful connections.</li>
                <li>I trust that the right opportunities will come through my relationships.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>My best connections happen when I am invited and recognized. If I’m in a space where I feel unseen or unappreciated, it drains my energy. I protect my social well-being by prioritizing aligned relationships that uplift me.</p>

              <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
              <p>My Te Whare Tapa Whā reminds me to honor my natural rhythm, set energetic boundaries, and lean into my unique gifts. My strength lies in my wisdom, ability to guide others, and deep connection with the right people. By staying aligned with my design, I maintain holistic well-being in all areas of my life.</p>
