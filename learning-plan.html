          <h2>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?
          </h2>
          <p>My long-term goal I aim to have established my own business and at the same time using my software development skills to grow within my business. I see tech as a gateway to freedom not just financial freedom for myself and my family, but also the ability to create tools, platforms, and solutions that can genuinely help people and uplift communities. I’d love to contribute to my iwi and the wider Māori and Pasifika communities by offering tools and knowledge that encourage more of us to enter and thrive in tech spaces.

          <h2>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
          </h2>
          <p>I want to use the skills I gain here to create digital products, web apps, and possibly mobile apps that focus on self-development, education, and creativity. Once I leave Dev Academy, I hope to land a remote role in tech while continuing to build out my personal brand and projects. My ultimate destination is a remote, flexible lifestyle where I’m doing work I’m proud of, giving back to my people, and making a global impact from wherever I am.

          <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
          </h2>
          <p>My biggest strengths are my resilience, creativity, and communication skills. I’m passionate about problem-solving and naturally enjoy working with others. I also bring an open mind and strong emotional intelligence to team environments.</p>
          <p>My limitations might be perfectionism and self-doubt—especially when learning something new and fast-paced. Sometimes I need to remind myself that it’s okay not to have all the answers immediately and to trust the process.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</h2>
          <p> Foundations definitely highlighted how much I enjoy breaking problems down and figuring them out, even when they’re frustrating. I’ve gained more confidence in my ability to learn independently, which is a huge win. However, I also noticed that I can get lost in the details and hesitate to move on until something is perfect. I now realise this could slow me down in a team setting, so I’ll be working on knowing when “good enough” is actually good enough—especially in pair programming and group tasks.

        <section>
          <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
          </h2>
          <p> Staying focused and consistent for the full nine weeks. I’m juggling other responsibilities at home, so time management and energy management will be key. I’ll need to set healthy boundaries and make sure I’m balancing productivity with rest.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h2>
          <p> I want to become a more confident collaborator especially in giving and receiving feedback with openness and grace. I’d also like to strengthen my leadership skills by supporting others and helping create a positive, inclusive space. Improving my reflective skills and being able to speak to my journey authentically is something I want to work on too.

          <h2>At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong>  Being clear and concise, especially when explaining code or giving feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-awareness: </strong>Noticing when I’m spiraling into perfectionism or self-doubt and catching it early.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Trusting the process of collaboration instead of trying to carry everything myself.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Practicing non-defensive listening and seeing feedback as a gift, not criticism.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          <p> I hope for a supportive, encouraging environment where facilitators lead with empathy and clarity. I’d love for them to challenge us while also understanding that everyone has a different learning pace. I appreciate constructive feedback and would love to feel like I can ask for help without judgment.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>What does support look like to you?
          </h2>
          <p>Support to me looks like open communication, safe spaces to ask questions (even the silly ones), and regular check-ins. It’s being seen as a whole person, not just a student. Encouragement, empathy, and honest feedback all help me feel safe enough to take risks and grow.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
          </h2>
          <p>To show up with intention, curiosity, and integrity. To keep going even when it gets hard, to ask for help when I need it, and to be a kind, thoughtful teammate. I also want to make space for reflection and celebrate the small wins along the way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h2>
          <p> I’ll use Discord to reach out to facilitators or peers, speak up during stand-ups or check-ins, and lean into pair programming sessions to ask questions in real time. I’ll also make time for regular reflection so I can identify when I’m stuck and what kind of help I need.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          </h2>
          <p> I commit to managing my workload by creating a structured routine that includes focused work blocks, regular breaks, and time to reflect and recharge. I’ll communicate clearly and respectfully with my teammates and facilitators, and I’ll speak up if I’m feeling overwhelmed. I’ll prioritize collaboration over competition, kindness over perfection, and progress over pressure. I’ll stay open to learning, not just about code, but about myself.

            <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
            <h2>1. Long-Term Goal / Career Pathway</h2>
            <p>My long-term career goal is to work as a software developer, specialising in full-stack development. I want to become proficient in both front-end and back-end development, focusing on building impactful, user-centric applications. In the long run, I also see myself contributing to the tech community through open-source projects and potentially mentoring future developers.</p>
            <p>Beyond technical expertise, I aim to be a present parent, work from home as much as possible to witness every milestone, and travel. I dream of having the ability to work from anywhere while being with my whānau as much as possible. Financial freedom and leading a team of developers, designers, and marketers to create products that people love is part of my vision. Ultimately, building a successful startup will bring personal fulfillment, with the excitement of seeing an idea turn into something impactful. DREAMS ARE BIG!</p>
