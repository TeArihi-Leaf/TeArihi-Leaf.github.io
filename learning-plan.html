            <h2>1. Long-Term Goal / Career Pathway</h2>
            <p>My long-term career goal is to work as a software developer, specializing in full-stack development. I want to become proficient in both front-end and back-end development, focusing on building impactful, user-centric applications. In the long run, I also see myself contributing to the tech community through open-source projects and potentially mentoring future developers.</p>
            <p>Beyond technical expertise, I aim to be a present parent, work from home as much as possible to witness every milestone, and travel. I dream of having the ability to work from anywhere while being with my whānau as much as possible. Financial freedom and leading a team of developers, designers, and marketers to create products that people love is part of my vision. Ultimately, building a successful startup will bring personal fulfillment, with the excitement of seeing an idea turn into something impactful. DREAMS ARE BIG!</p>
