            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?</h2>
            <p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the ability to recognise, understand, manage, and influence your own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It involves a range of skills, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: Recognizing and understanding your own emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-regulation</strong>: Managing your emotions in healthy ways and adapting to situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Motivation</strong>: Using emotions to focus and achieve goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy</strong>: Understanding the emotions of others and responding appropriately.</li>
                <li><strong>Social skills</strong>: Building and maintaining relationships, and effectively communicating with others.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How is EQ Different from IQ?</h2>
            <p>EQ and IQ are both important but focus on different aspects of intelligence:</p>

                <div class="iq">
                    <h3>IQ (Intelligence Quotient)</h3>
                    <p>Measures cognitive abilities, such as logical reasoning, problem-solving, and analytical thinking. Typically assessed through standardized tests, IQ reflects a person's intellectual potential.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="eq">
                    <h3>EQ (Emotional Intelligence)</h3>
                    <p>Focuses on emotional and social aspects of intelligence. It relates to how well you manage your own emotions and understand and respond to the emotions of others.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>While IQ tends to be more static over time, EQ can be developed and improved through practice and learning.</p>

        <section class="importance">
            <h2>Why is EQ Important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Better Relationships:</strong> High EQ helps you connect with others on an emotional level, fostering strong, healthy relationships in both personal and professional contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Regulation:</strong> It helps in managing stress and emotions, leading to better decision-making and coping mechanisms in difficult situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Success in the Workplace:</strong> Many workplace outcomes, like leadership, teamwork, and communication, are influenced by a person’s emotional intelligence. People with high EQ tend to be more adaptable, effective communicators, and conflict resolvers.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> By understanding and managing emotions, people with high EQ are less likely to experience mental health issues like anxiety and depression.</li>
                <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Leaders with high EQ can inspire and motivate teams, manage conflicts, and create positive work environments.</li>
