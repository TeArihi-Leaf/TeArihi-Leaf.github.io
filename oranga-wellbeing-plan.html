    <h1>Oranga / Wellbeing Plan — Bootcamp Update</h1>
    <p>I updated my wellbeing / oranga plan during Bootcamp and added it to my learning blog. Foundations gave me a solid starting point, but Bootcamp showed me I needed more flexibility, compassion, and balance to move through the mahi as a Māori wāhine, a māmā, and a future founder.</p>

    <h2>Tinana (Physical)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily movement: gym when energy allows, walks after drop-offs, or stretching on low days.</li>
      <li>Kai & wai: lean lower-carb for less bloating and steadier energy; hydrate throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Rest: aim for 7–8 hours sleep, guilt-free early nights when needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hinengaro (Mental)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Journaling: regular reflections to process thoughts, bugs, and breakthroughs.</li>
      <li>Mindfulness: short breaks, breathing, or karakia to reset during study blocks.</li>
      <li>Positive kōrero: replace “I can’t” with “I’m still learning.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wairua (Spiritual)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Morning karakia or gratitude to start the day intentionally.</li>
      <li>Connection with te taiao: sunlight, whenua, fresh air for wairua reset.</li>
      <li>Protecting energy: say no when overwhelmed, prioritising inner peace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Whānau (Social / Emotional)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Whānau time: prioritise quality time with my son and partner.</li>
      <li>Lean on support systems: facilitators, classmates, and loved ones.</li>
      <li>Celebrate wins together: milestones, breakthroughs, and progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>He Whakaaro (Reflection)</h2>
    <p>Updating this plan mid-Bootcamp helped me reconnect with my values and keep my hauora balanced. Some weeks I was consistent; others I reset and tried again. This plan isn’t about perfection — it’s about awareness and self-respect. It represents who I’m becoming: a grounded Māori wāhine in tech, balancing mahi, motherhood, and self-growth with aroha and purpose.</p>
