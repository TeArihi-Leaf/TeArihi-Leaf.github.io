  <section class="eq-vs-iq">
    
    <div class="iq">
      <h2>1. Taha Tinana (Physical Well-being)</h2>
      <p>Daily movement: gym when energy allows, walks after drop-offs, or stretching on low days.</p>
      <p>Kai & wai: lean lower-carb for less bloating and steadier energy; hydrate throughout the day.</p>
      <p>Rest: aim for 7–8 hours sleep, guilt-free early nights when needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="eq">
      <h2>2. Taha Hinengaro (Mental Well-being)</h2>
      <p>Journaling: regular reflections to process thoughts, bugs, and breakthroughs.</p>
      <p>Mindfulness: short breaks, breathing, or karakia to reset during study blocks.</p>
      <p>Positive kōrero: replace “I can’t” with “I’m still learning.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="iq">
      <h2>3. Taha Wairua (Spiritual Well-being)</h2>
      <p>Morning karakia or gratitude to start the day intentionally.</p>
      <p>Connection with te taiao: sunlight, whenua, and fresh air for wairua reset.</p>
      <p>Protecting energy: say no when overwhelmed, prioritising inner peace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="eq">
      <h2>4. Taha Whānau (Social & Emotional Well-being)</h2>
      <p>Whānau time: prioritise quality time with my son and partner.</p>
      <p>Lean on support systems: facilitators, classmates, and loved ones.</p>
      <p>Celebrate wins together: milestones, breakthroughs, and progress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="iq">
      <h2>5. He Whakaaro (Reflection)</h2>
      <p>Updating this plan mid-Bootcamp helped me reconnect with my values and keep my hauora balanced. Some weeks I was consistent; others I reset and tried again. This plan isn’t about perfection — it’s about awareness and self-respect. It represents who I’m becoming: a grounded Māori wāhine in tech, balancing mahi, motherhood, and self-growth with aroha and purpose.</p>
