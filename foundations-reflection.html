        <h2>1. What are three new things you’ve learnt about yourself and your ego through the Human Skills learning?</h2>
       
          <li>
            I’ve realised my ego gets loud when I feel like I don’t know something—it makes me hesitate to ask for help because I don’t want to look dumb.
          </li>
          <li>
            I didn’t notice how much I tie my self-worth to productivity until now. If I’m not “doing” enough, I feel like I’m not enough.
          </li>
          <li>
            I’ve also seen how my ego can trick me into staying in my comfort zone. Like, it’ll make me overthink or avoid challenges just to “protect” me from failing—but that holds me back.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. What’s the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>They’re actually way more important than I thought.</p>
        
          <li><strong>Values</strong> guide how I approach challenges and teamwork. Integrity, patience, and curiosity push me to write clean, meaningful code.</li>
          <li><strong>Empathy</strong> helps me collaborate with others, write user-centered applications, and understand team dynamics. Supports having empathy for myself too.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> allows me to recognise when I’m stuck, frustrated, or procrastinating and pivot toward asking for help or adjusting my approach.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. What’s surprised you the most about Human Skills learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, how much it’s helped outside of coding too. I didn’t expect this kind of self-development to be part of a coding bootcamp, but it’s made me more confident, more patient with myself, and even better at communicating. It’s wild how mindset shifts can change the whole game.

      <section>
        <h2>4. What were the most challenging parts of the Human Skills learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Being real with myself. Like actually sitting with the uncomfortable stuff & facing limiting beliefs, owning up to my emotional reactions, and accepting feedback without getting defensive. It’s not easy to admit your patterns, but it’s been worth it.
        </p>
      </section>
  
      <section>
        <h2>5. Why do you think a programming school spends so much time on Human Skills learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Because coding isn’t just technical—it’s emotional too. You face frustration, imposter syndrome, team dynamics, feedback, and tight deadlines. If you don’t know how to regulate yourself or communicate well, even great coding skills won’t take you far. This stuff builds resilience and helps you work better with people, which is crucial in tech.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Does it feel like a waste of time? Wouldn’t that time be better spent coding?</h2>
        <p>
          Not at all. If anything, it’s made my coding journey smoother. When I hit roadblocks now, I don’t spiral like I used to. I step back, breathe, and find solutions quicker because of the mindset tools we’ve learned. Coding is important, but knowing how to keep going when things get hard? That’s just as valuable.
